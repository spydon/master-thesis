                      Uppsala Beamer TODO
======================================================================

* Make sure that in plain mode, the sidebar width goes to size 0

* Create a "keyword macro" that blanks some texts in the handout mode
  and shows it in other modes. Useful to make the students take notes.
  (in another package)
* Update the keyword macro to include portion of the text or graphs

* Create good-looking smileys like :) and :(, or find images and
  include them in the uu folder

* Update the notes mode to reflect smarter use.

* Publish my script for slides creation. (Should probably clean it first!)

* Redesign the myslide as makefile to use latexmk -pdf --silent

* Add a small white round dot for each section we come across in the progress bar.

* Create a horizontal progression bar at the top of the slides
